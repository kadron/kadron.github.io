I'm Ismet Burak Kadron, born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1992. I have completed my Bachelor's degree on Computer Engineering at Bogazici Universitesi, Turkey in 2010. 
I'm currently a PhD student in [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.ucsb.edu) at [UC Santa Barbara](https://ucsb.edu) and a member of [Verification Lab](https://vlab.cs.ucsb.edu). 

My research interests are on program analysis, information theory, security, machine learning (ML). Iâ€™m focused on finding methods on automating side-channel analysis and vulnerability detection at the moment.
I am also interested in using formal methods for verifying safety and security of ML systems.
