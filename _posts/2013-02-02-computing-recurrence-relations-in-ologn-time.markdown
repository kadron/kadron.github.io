Some of you probably know Richard Ayoade as Moss in The IT Crowd but less people know of him as a filmmaker. If you already know his films, this post might not tell you anything new but if you haven't seen Submarine or The Double, you're in for a treat. Both are very British feeling films, both in the sense of humor and drama. It's hard to explain a feeling but I will try. Submarine takes place in cold Wales and while the Double takes place in a dystopic and retro-futuristic (as Douglas Adams would say, zeerust[^1]) world, it's always dark and cold
