#### Netrunner

A popular card game by Richard Garfield of Magic the Gathering fame. In his article of [Design Lessons from Poker](http://press.etc.cmu.edu/content/design-lessons-poker-richard-garfield), he talks about how luck and skill are contrasted in the communities of board game designers and gamers.He proposes that poker contains both high amounts of luck and skill unlike the common belief of designers. He also comments on flexible framework, quick games, hidden information and how the stakes affect the game. It is pretty clear that those design decisions are applied to Netrunner because it contains hidden information, taking risks, containing quick games in a grander game.

Magic the Gathering is a much symmetric game as both persons play creatures, sorceries, enchantments, etc. to bring other person's life points down to zero. Netrunner differs from MtG by theme and gameplay as well. Its theme is cyberpunk, with evil corporations on one side controlling lives of people using surveillance, planning their agendas and building assets, also protecting them using ICE[^1]. On the other side, the runners break into servers of corporations using icebreakers, special hardware and human resources to steal their assets, foil their agendas in the cause of money, knowledge, art or freedom.

As the opponents are corporations and runners, the gameplay reflects that difference as well. Corporations play their cards closed (installing in servers) and can reveal them anytime by paying their rez cost. This helps with the bluffing as the ICE and assets are hidden from the runner. In return, the runner can make a run to any server. The meaning of this is the runner can gain access to the user's hand(HQ), deck(R&D) and discard pile(Archives) and also the assets(Remote Server) corp sets up. Of course corporations are protecting themselves with ICE and this is where bluffing part comes in. Making a run to a server is a loss of money for runner for something s/he may not know if cards aren't revealed. The corp can convince the runner that the card is an agenda (brings points to the corp if scored and to the runner if stolen) making the runner lose precious credits and clicks.

It's hard for me to explain the game in 2 paragraphs as the game's rulebook is roughly 30 pages but I hope I have evoked a sense of competition between two different sides and its strong cyberpunk theme. I'm playing this game for 4 months or so and even though the games take at least 50-60 minutes which is a bit longer than the other board games I play, it's quite fun. If you're a cyberpunk fan or want to try a solid 1v1 game, you should try it. This is the best boardgame of my collection and best game made by Richard Garfield.

#### Province

This is a game that I learned about and backed with the help of Kickstarter. You can check it [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/laboratory/province-a-competitive-building-microgame-for-2-pl/). The game's genre is worker placement/building. It is similar to Lords of Waterdeep or the Settlers of Catan but in a simplified format. The reason for this is the game is actually a "microgame". It can fit in a trousers pocket and the aim is to play it as a starter as it takes between 10-15 minutes to play the game.

Two people representing two influential families in a province try to gain the most victory points with the help of common workers. Victory points are gained by building structures first or completing quests. If the ending conditions are met, the game ends and the person with most victory points win. The unique part about this game is its worker system. The workers can be used as a money source or a workforce source. The catch is this, the workers are in a cycle which represents the money and workforce options and they can be moved one step in a single turn. This means your usage of the workers affect the options your opponent gets in her/his turn.

I played it four times with my friends and I think it's pretty simple and fun to play. It's not too dumbed down and there is a sense of competition in it because your actions may block what your opponent is planning. I heartily recommend it.
