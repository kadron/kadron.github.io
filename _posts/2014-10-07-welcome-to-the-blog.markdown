Hello everyone! I am Burak Kadron, a ginger, tabletop gamer, film lover and a fan of British comedy. So, posts here will mostly be about my opinion about movies, games and festivals. I am also an engineer, so there may be tech stuff as well. The style may not look so good but I plan to change it in future when I excel in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby gem about creating blogs.

There may also be something completely different.
