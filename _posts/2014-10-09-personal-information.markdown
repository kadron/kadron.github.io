Hello everyone! I am Burak Kadron, and this post will be about myself and what I may post here.

I am an avid tabletop gamer and film lover, so posts here will mostly be about my opinion about movies, games and festivals. I am also an engineer, so there may be tech stuff as well. The style may not look so good but I plan to change it in future when I excel in [Jekyll], a Ruby gem about creating blogs.
